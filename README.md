# Bayesian-clustered-data-treatment-models

This repository contains the implementation of a Bayesian analysis of the effect of a categorical treatment variable on a response. The treatment is non-randomly assigned and the response is observed for one setting of the treatment. The models used in this analysis are designed for such problems and are subjected to a fully Bayesian analysis based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
